## Description

BuildBot is a bot made with the intent to help League of Legends players enhance their ranked experience at various ranks. The bot permits you to look up character builds and it will automatically find the top guides based on specific criteria from Mobafire and make that short champion selection screen more calculated. We hope to incorporate what we evaluate as essential functionality for any discord servers interested in convincing their members within their ranked experience.
